    <p>
        Pyglet communication occurs mostly in our
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users">mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
        issue tracker
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can use the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/issues">issue tracker</a>
        to report any bug or compatibility issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        We prefer the tracker to address discussions on specific bugs,
        and address broader topics of Pyglet in the mailing list.

    <h2>
        contributing to the documentation
    </h2>
    <p>
        When asking to include your code in the trunk, check that you have addressed its
        respective documentation, both within the code and the API documentation.
        It is very important to all of us that the documentation matches the latest code and vice-versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consequently, an error in the documentation, either because it is hard to understand or because
        it doesn't match the code, <strong>is</strong> a bug that deserves to be reported on a ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good way to start contributing to a component of pyglet is by its documentation.
        When studying the code you are going to work with, also read the associated docs.
        If you don't understand the code with the help of the docs, it is a sign that
        the docs should be improved.
    </p>
