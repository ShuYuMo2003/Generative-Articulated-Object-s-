Building the documentation
--------------------------

In order to build the documentation you'll need all pyglet's requirements,
plus the following:

* Sphinx and its requirements (1.1.3 recommended): http://sphinx-doc.org/
* Graphviz (optional): http://graphviz.org/
* A `make` tool: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

Once you have all the requirements installed you can run build the HTML
documentation with:

    make html

The HTML docs will be generated in the _build subdirectory.

Please run `make help` for a complete list of targets, but be aware that some
of them may have extra requirements.
