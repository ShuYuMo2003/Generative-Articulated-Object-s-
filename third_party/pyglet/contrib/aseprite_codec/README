This is an example of a custom image codec.
Custom codecs can be created and added at runtime
in your application, allowing you to add support
for loading specialized image and animation formats.

This codec adds support for the Aseprite binary
format, which is a popular software for creating
animated sprites.

This codec is fairly complete, with the limitation
of only supporting "normal" blending mode for layers.
